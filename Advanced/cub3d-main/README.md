## ABOUT
This is a graphics programming project where I created a 3D game in C, using the minilibx library. I learned about raycasting, basic algorithms, rendering 3D environments, textures, windows, colours, events, shape filling, wall collision, map parsing, mini-map, ...

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, by the famous John Carmack and John Romero (Id Software), and published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games.

A replica of the original game is available to play online <a href="http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/">here</a>.

- [References](https://github.com/jotavare/42-resources#04-cub3d) `GitHub`

## HOW TO USE
#### 1º - Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jotavare/cub3d.git
```

#### 2º - Enter the project folder and run `make mlx`
> [!NOTE]  
> This rule is not mandatory but necessary to run the game because the minilibx library is not included.
```bash
cd cub3d/cub3d
make mlx
```

#### 3º - Run the game with a map of your choice
```bash
make re
./cub3d [map.cub]
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

| Rules | Information |
| :-- | :-- |
| `make`		| Compile so_long files. 									|
| `make all`	| Compile mandatory files.									|
| `make clean`	| Delete all .o (object files) files.						|
| `make fclean`	| Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.	|
| `make re`		| Use rules `fclean` + `all`.								|
| `make norm`	| Uses the norminette on the libft and cub3d source files.	|
| `make mlx`	| Downloads and compiles the minilibx library.				|

## MANDATORY
#### MAIN RULES
- [x] Must use MiniLibX library;
- [x] The game window must remain smooth: changing to another window, minimizing, etc;
- [x] Display different wall textures that vary depending on which side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West);
- [x] Must be able to set the floor and ceiling colours to two different ones;

#### WINDOWS AND KEYS
- [x] Displays the image in a window;
- [x] Left and right arrow keys must allow you to look left and right in the maze.
- [x] The `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys must allow you to move the point of view through the maze.
- [x] Pressing `ESC` or clicking on the `cross` on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.

#### MAP PARSING/VALIDATION
> [!NOTE] 
> The program must be able to parse any kind of map, as long it respects the rules:
- [x] The program has to take as a parameter a map description file ending with the `.cub` extension.
- [x] The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not, the program must return an error.
- [x] Map content always has to be the last.
- [x] Separated by one or more empty line(s).
- [x] Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
- [x] Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s).
- [x] If an error/misconfiguration is encountered, it should return `Error\n` followed by an explicit message.

#### .cub COMPONENTS
- [x] The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters.
- [x] Each element's first information is the type identifier, followed by all specific information for each object;

| Characters | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `0`               | Empty space.                           |
| `1`               | Wall.                                  |
| `N` `S` `E` `W`   | Player start position and orientation. |

| Name | Example | Identifier | Information |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| North texture:  | `NO ./path_to_the_north_texture` | NO | Path to the north texure.                   |
| South texture:  | `SO ./path_to_the_south_texture` | SO | Path to the south texure.                   |
| West texture:   | `WE ./path_to_the_west_texture`  | WE | Path to the west texure.                    |
| East texture:   | `EA ./path_to_the_east_texture`  | EA | Path to the east texure.                    |
| Floor colour:   | `F 220,100,0`                    | F  | R,G,B colours in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255 |
| Ceiling colour: | `C 225,30,0`                     | C  | R,G,B colours in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255 |

> Example of a valid `.cub` map:
```bash
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
EA ./path_to_the_east_texture

F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0

## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
