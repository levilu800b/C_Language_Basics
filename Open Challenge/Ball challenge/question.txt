You have 12 balls identical in size and appearance but 1 is an odd weight (could be either light or heavy).

balance scales
You have a set of balance scales which will give 3 possible readings:

Left = Right,
Left > Right, or
Left < Right
(i.e. Left and Right have equal weight, Left is Heavier, or Left is Lighter).

You have only 3 chances to weigh the balls in any combination using the scales.

Find which ball is the odd one and if it's heavier or lighter than the rest.

How do you do it?
